# Synthetic Fruit Dataset Generation
To utilize this script, you will need to combine the following previously normalized datasets:
1. Background images
2. Depth maps of the background images
3. Trimmed images of fruits without backgrounds
4. Images simulating lights (optional)

For testing the script, you can use the following data: [Download Test Data](https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1YIBQHP9dPglBPG68jbxD7MYx0SlHK3z_&export=download&authuser=0)
